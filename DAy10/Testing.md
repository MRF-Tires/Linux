# 🐧 Essential Linux Commands with Real-World Use Cases

This guide is designed for trainers and students to understand and practically apply the most common Linux commands used in real-time environments.

---

## 🔍 1. `grep` – Global Regular Expression Print

### Description:
`grep` is used to search text using patterns (regular expressions). It's great for filtering output or searching logs.

### Common Options:
- `-i`: Ignore case
- `-r`: Recursive search
- `-n`: Show line numbers
- `-v`: Invert match
- `-E`: Extended regex

### Use Cases:
- Find error messages in logs:
  ```bash
  grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog
  ```
- Search recursively in config files:
  ```bash
  grep -r "nginx" /etc/
  ```
- Show lines NOT containing "active":
  ```bash
  grep -v "active" services.txt
  ```

## 🧮 2. `awk` – Pattern Scanning and Text Processing

### Description:
`awk` reads line by line, splits each line into fields, and allows pattern matching and actions.

### Syntax:
```bash
awk 'pattern {action}' filename
```

### Use Cases:
- Print usernames and home directories:
  ```bash
  awk -F: '{print $1, $6}' /etc/passwd
  ```
- Sum column values in a file:
  ```bash
  awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' students.txt
  ```
- Show names with marks > 80:
  ```bash
  awk '$2 > 80 {print $1}' students.txt
  ```

---

## ✂️ 3. `sed` – Stream Editor

### Description:
`sed` edits files or streams using expressions. Perfect for replacing, deleting, or inserting text.

### Use Cases:
- Replace "nginx" with "apache":
  ```bash
  sed 's/nginx/apache/g' config.txt
  ```
- Delete empty lines:
  ```bash
  sed '/^$/d' file.txt
  ```
- Insert a line after match:
  ```bash
  sed '/root/a This line is added after root' file.txt
  ```

---

## 📊 4. `top` – Real-Time System Monitor

### Description:
Displays running processes, CPU, and memory usage in real-time.

### Useful Keys:
- `q`: Quit
- `P`: Sort by CPU
- `M`: Sort by memory

### Use Cases:
- View resource-hungry processes:
  ```bash
  top
  ```

---

## ⏱️ 5. `uptime` – Show How Long System Has Been Running

### Description:
Displays uptime, number of users, and system load averages.

### Use Cases:
- Check system stability:
  ```bash
  uptime
  ```

### Output Example:
```
14:20:43 up 12 days,  4:17,  2 users,  load average: 0.14, 0.19, 0.25
```

---

## 💾 6. `df` – Disk Space Usage

### Description:
Reports file system disk space usage.

### Use Cases:
- Human-readable disk usage:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
- Check disk usage of specific path:
  ```bash
  df -h /home
  ```

### Output Example:
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G   15G   32G  32% /
```

## 🧠 Practice Scenario Table

| Command | Practice Task |
|---------|----------------|
| `grep`  | Search failed login in `/var/log/auth.log` |
| `awk`   | Extract usernames from `/etc/passwd` |
| `sed`   | Replace port number in config file |
| `top`   | Identify high CPU usage process |
| `uptime`| Check if system rebooted recently |
| `df`    | Alert if any partition is over 90% full |

---

## 📁 Create Sample File for Practice

```bash
echo -e "John 85\nAlice 90\nBob 70\nCharlie 88" > students.txt
awk '$2 > 80 {print $1}' students.txt
sed 's/John/Jonathan/' students.txt
```

---

## ✅ Trainer Tips

- Use live examples from `/var/log/`, `/etc/passwd`
- Highlight important output in terminal
- Engage students with challenges per command
- Demonstrate using real-time monitoring tools like `top` and `df` with `watch`

**Happy Teaching! 🎓**
```

Let me know if you want a section added for `watch`, `ps`, or any more advanced commands like `netstat`, `iostat`, etc.
